# Arquivo.pt Page Search System

This project aims to replace the legacy search system. The legacy search system, Nutchwax based, will be decrepated by Solr as the full-text search backend. In order to accomplish this, it provides a new API implementation to decouple Arquivo.pt API from the old project, making it backend agnostic and working with both Nutchwax and Solr systems.
